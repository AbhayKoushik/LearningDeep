Processing, evaluating and tuning Deep Neural Networks

● ANN - Artificial Neural Networks

Dataset Description: A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. Here is a 10.000 records dataset to investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon.

Classifier built as an experiment to learn about the different features of ANNs in Keras, with TensorFlow backend. The accuracies obtained have a lot of scope for improvement.

● CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks

Dataset Description: A clean, preprocessed image dataset containing 10000 cat and dog images. Training set of 8000 and test set of 2000 images. 

Classifier built to experiment around with different features of CNNs in Keras. This helps in understanding how important it is to reduce the dimensions through convolutions and max pooling to better the accuracies.

● RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks

Basic Structure is added, need to be evaluated, tuned and improvised
Stay tuned!
